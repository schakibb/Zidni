              </h4>
              <p>
                Graphs are data structures composed of a set of vertices, with
                the aim of representing relationships between objects.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>Real-life example of using Graphs:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>- Social Networks: </strong> As mentioned earlier,
                  social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn
                  utilize graphs to represent connections between users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>- Transportation Networks: </strong> Road networks,
                  railway systems, and airline routes can be represented as
                  graphs, where nodes represent locations (such as cities or
                  stations) and edges represent the connections between them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>- Internet and Web: </strong> The World Wide Web can
                  be represented as a graph, where web pages are nodes and
                  hyperlinks between pages are edges.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>- Recommendation Systems: </strong> Graphs are used in
                  recommendation systems to model relationships between users,
                  products, or content, helping to suggest relevant items based
                  on connections within the graph.

                - <strong>Successors:</strong> In a directed graph, the

                following the outgoing edges from that vertex.
                <br />
                Example: In the graph below, the successors of vertex 2 are
                vertices 5 and 4.
              </p>
              <Graphe nodes={"1,2,2,5,2,4,3,6"} link="->" />
              <p>
                - <strong>Predecessors:</strong> In a directed graph, the
                predecessors of a vertex are the vertices from which the
                incoming edges to that vertex originate.
                <br />
                Example: In the graph below, the predecessors of vertex 4 are
                vertices 2 and 3.
              </p>

                - <strong>Out-degree:</strong> The number of edges leaving a
                vertex.
                <br />
                Example: In the graph below, the out-degree of vertex 2 is 2
                (edges to 4 and 5).
              </p>
              <Graphe nodes={"1,2,2,5,2,4,3,6"} link="->" />
              <p>
                - <strong>In-degree:</strong> The number of edges entering a
                vertex.
                <br />
                Example: In the graph below, the in-degree of vertex 4 is 2
                (edges from 2 and 3).

              <p>
                An incidence matrix is a 2D array where rows represent vertices
                and columns represent edges. Each cell is 1 if the vertex is
                incident to the edge, and 0 otherwise.
