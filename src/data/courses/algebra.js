              A matrix is a mathematical structure consisting of numbers
              organized in rows and columns. Formally, a matrix is a rectangular
              grid of numerical elements. The elements of a matrix can be real
              numbers, complex numbers, or even algebraic expressions. A matrix
              is usually defined by its dimensions, i.e., the number of rows and
              the number of columns. For example, a matrix with m rows and n
              columns is called a matrix of size m×n.

              </h4>
              Calculating the determinant of a matrix by expanding along a row
              or column is a method that can be applied to matrices of any size.
              Here's a step-by-step explanation for this method
              <br />
              1- Write the matrix.
              <br />
              2- Choose a row or a column: For simplicity, let's choose the
              first row (you can choose any row or column).
              <br />
              3- Expand along the chosen row: The determinant of matrix A can be
              calculated by taking the sum of the products of the elements of
              the row and their corresponding cofactors.The cofactor Cij​ is
              calculated as:
              <br />
              4- Calculate the minors and cofactors for each element in the
              first row.
              <br />
              5- Calculate the determinant:
              <br />
              det(A)=aC11​+bC12​+cC13​= a(ei−fh)+b(fg−di)+c(dh−eg)

              The Sarrus method is a simple technique for calculating the
              determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Here are the detailed steps to use

              <br />
              1- Write the matrix.
              <br />
              2- Copy the first two columns to the right of the matrix.
              <br />
              3- Calculate the products of the downward diagonals (from top left
              to bottom right) and sum them.
              <br />
              <strong>aei+bfg+cdh</strong>
              <br />
              - aei: product of the elements on the main diagonal.
              <br />
              - bfg: product of the elements of the second downward diagonal.
              <br />
              - cdh: product of the elements of the third downward diagonal.
              <br />
              4- Calculate the products of the upward diagonals (from bottom
              left to top right) and sum them:
              <br />
              <stong>ceg+bdi+afh</stong>
              <br />
              - ceg: product of the elements of the main upward diagonal.
              <br />
              - bdi: product of the elements of the second upward diagonal.
              <br />
              - afh: product of the elements of the third upward diagonal.
              <br />
              5- Subtract the sum of the upward diagonal products from the sum
              of the downward diagonal products:
              <br />
              Determinant=(aei+bfg+cdh)−(ceg+bdi+afh)
              <br />
              In summary, the determinant of matrix A is given by the formula:
              <br />
              det(A)=aei+bfg+cdh−ceg−bdi−afh
