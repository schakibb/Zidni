                A file, in computing, is a way of storing, organizing and
                managing information (or data) permanently or temporarily on a
                storage medium, such as a hard drive, a optical disk, USB stick,
                etc. The data contained in a file can be of any nature : texts,
                images, sounds, videos, programs, etc. Generally speaking, we
                can distinguish two types of files depending on their content:
                Files programs and data files.

                </h4>{" "}
                These are files that contain the instructions necessary to the
                execution of a program. Example : <br />- Chrome.exe: is a
                program file that allows you to browse the web. <br />-
                Excel.exe: is a program file that allows you to create and
                manipulate spreadsheets.

                These are files specially designed to store and organize data.
                data that a program is likely to use, as well as the results it
                can achieve. Unlike program files, data files are scalable,
                which means that it is possible to modify them, to delete
                information from them, to add information to them information,
                or simply to consult them. Example: Student.dat is a data file
                that may contain information relating to students of a school
                such as last name, first name, date of birth, grade, etc.

                The computer only understands binary language, a sequence of 0s
                and 1s. This is why all information must be converted into a
                series of bits before being processed by the computer. This
                information is organized into:
                <ul>
                  <li>- Characters</li>
                  <li>- Zones</li>

                The character is a grouping of bits (7, 8, 16,...) used to
                represent a character alphanumeric (0, 1, 2, a, b, c, ...) or a
                special character (#, @, ...) in any encoding such as as: ASCII,
                UNICODE, etc. Character is the smallest unit of information that
                can be represented and processed by a computer.{" "}

                On the other hand, a file, abstractly, is a set of information

                objects (concrete or abstract) possessing common
                characteristics. A file is characterized by the following
                elements:
                <ul>
                  <li>-NAME</li>

                and physically contains the recordings defined in the logic
                file. In other words, a physical file is the result of storing
                the logical file on physical media. The records in the physical
                file are called physical records (or blocks). <br />

                recipe and the resulting dish, before and after its preparation.
                Here the recipe represents the logical file, and the flat

              <div>
                The blocking factor is the number of logical records contained
                in a physical record. It is calculated as follows:
                <br />
                <em>
                  Blocking factor = Number of logical records / Number of

                The operations of reading and writing the file data on the
                storage medium are carried out record by record. Exchanges are
                made between the main memory (RAM) and the physical media.
                Consequently, blocking a certain number of logical records into
                physical records essentially makes it possible to optimize
                Input/Output (I/O) operations by saving response time.
                <br />
                Example : Let's say we have a file containing 100 records, and
                we use a blocking factor of 1 (FB = 1). In this configuration,
                we would need 100 Input/Output (I/O) operations to read the
                entire file. However, if we increase the blocking factor to 2,
                then we could accomplish the same task using only 50 I/O
                operations.

                <strong> Renewal rate:</strong> The renewal rate represents the
                proportion of new records added to the total number of existing
                records in the file during a given period. <br />
                <em>
                  Renewal rate = (Number of new records added) / (Total number
                  of records at the start of the period)
                </em>
                <br /> <strong>File Stability:</strong>
                File stability is relative to a given period. A file is said to
                be stable for a period if the number of records created is
                approximately equal to the number of records deleted.

              <div>
                We can distinguish several types of files according to:
                <ul>
                  <li>-The nature of the information it contains</li>
                  <li>-The type of media used for its storage</li>
                  <li>-Organization of information</li>
                  <li>-Lifetime</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                  <strong>
                    9.1.According to the nature of the information:
                  </strong>
                </h4>
                A file can contain two types of information: data or programs,
                and depending on the case, we speak of a data file or a program
                file.
                <h4>
                  <strong>
                    9.2.According to the type of media used for storage:
                  </strong>
                </h4>
                Although the content of a file remains the same regardless of
                the medium used to store it, certain characteristics of the file
                are closely linked to the nature of this medium, and in
                particular the mode of access to the data it contains. For
                example, for a file stored on a magnetic tape, only sequential
                access can be practiced, whereas on a magnetic disk, access can
                be sequential, but also direct. This fact is mainly due to the
                manufacturing technologies used for storage units.
                <br />
                These technologies will be studied in chapter 2.
                <h4>
                  <strong>
                    9.3.According to the organization of information:
                  </strong>
                </h4>
                The organization adopted for a file is one of its most important
                characteristics, since it allows you to define the way of
                accessing the information it contains. We can distinguish three
                main types:
                <ul>
                  <li>Sequential organization</li>
                  <li>Indexed sequential organization</li>
                  <li>Random (or direct) organization</li>
                </ul>
                These organizational methods will be studied in chapter 3.
                <h4>
                  <strong>9.4.According to the lifetime:</strong>
                </h4>
                Files can be classified into five types:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    -<strong>Permanent files: </strong>
                    is a file whose information is of vital importance within
                    the application for which it was designed. Its content does
                    not undergo frequent modifications; it must be constantly
                    checked, given its importance. To avoid the risk of loss of
                    information, it is useful to make backup copies.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    -<strong>Movement files: </strong>
                    the movement file is used to update a permanent file. He is
                    characterized by a short lifespan. At the end of treatment,
                    it is no longer useful.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    -<strong>Maneuver files: </strong>
                    the maneuver file finds its reason for being when there is
                    not enough of space in central memory to contain all the
                    data necessary for a certain processing. Its lifespan is
                    limited by that of the treatment that created it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    -<strong>Intermediate files: </strong>
                    contains results of a given treatment to be used either
                    during the same treatment or by other subsequent treatments.
                    It allows the exchange of data between programs, unlike the
                    maneuver file which only communicates its data to the same
                    processing it generated. In addition, the lifespan of an
                    intermediate file is not limited by that of the processing
                    that created it, in order to allow other processing to use
                    it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    -<strong>Archive and historical files: </strong>
                    allows you to keep track of the treatments carried out
                    during a given period. The difference between an archive
                    file and a historical file essentially lies in the
                    periodicity. A historical file is periodic (at the end of
                    each week, each month or half-year, etc).
                    <br />
                    Example: At the end of each semester, the results obtained
                    by the students are stored in a 'Result_S' file. This file
                    is a historical file since student results are recorded in
                    this file periodically (at the end of each semester). The
                    'Result_S' file will contain the students' semester results.
                    If, for the development of the 'Result_S' file, we had used
                    intermediate files: Result_S1, Result_S2, Result_S3 and we
                    had kept them, they would then be archive files.

            subChapterContent: (
              <div>
                The basic operations that can be performed on a file are:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    -<strong>Create a file:</strong>
                    Create its structure, that is to say, define the different
                    fields, as well as the length of your articles. Enter the
                    items from the file and store them on a physical medium
                    (magnetic tape, disk, etc.).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    -<strong>Delete a file:</strong>
                    <br />
                    <span>
                      -Logical deletion involves marking the file in a way that
                      makes it transparent, in reality it still exists on the
                      media.
                    </span>
                    <br />{" "}
                    <span>
                      -Physical deletion erases the file permanently. The space
                      previously occupied by the file will be reclaimed.
                    </span>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    -<strong>Update a file:</strong>
                    The update includes the following three treatments:
                    <br />
                    <span>-Addition: adding new records to the file.</span>
                    <br />
                    <span>
                      -Modification: changing the content of one or more
                      records.
                    </span>
                    <br />
                    <span>
                      -Deletion: removing one or more records from the file.
                    </span>
                    The update is generally carried out on a permanent file, via
                    a movement file.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    -<strong>File reunion:</strong>
                    Several sender files give rise to a new file.
                    <br />
                    Noticed : During the meeting, changes can be made to make
                    the new file easier to handle. A field can be split into
                    several fields, or the opposite, combine several fields to
                    form one. But, the content of the recording remains the
                    same.
                    <br />
                    Example : Consider several sender files containing
                    information on a company's employees. Each transmitter file
                    contains the following data:
                    <br />
                    .Number
                    <br />
                    .Name
                    <br />
                    .First name
                    <br />
                    .Address (for example: Rue de Rabia, 1600 Algiers)
                    <br /> The company wants to create a new file to perform
                    geographic analyses, so it must divide the 'Address' field
                    into 'Street', 'Postal Code' and 'City' subfields as
                    follows:
                    <br />
                    .Number
                    <br />
                    .Name
                    <br />
                    .First name
                    <br />
                    .Street: Rabia
                    <br />
                    .Postcode: 1600
                    <br />
                    .City: Algiers
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>The bursting :</strong>
                    This is the opposite operation of the reunion. A sender file
                    gives rise to several receiver files.
                    <br />
                    Noticed : Here, again, changes can be made to the file
                    structure but not to the content.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Sile sorting:</strong>
                    Sorting a file means sorting its records in ascending or
                    descending order by the value of one or more attributes
                    called "sort arguments".
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Files fusion:</strong>
                    It consists of grouping the recordings of two or more files
                    into a single file.
                    <br />
                    Noticed : The files to be merged must have the same
                    structure. Therefore, the resulting file will have the same
                    structure as the files that gave rise to it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Extraction :</strong>
                    This processing consists of extracting or copying recordings
                    or parts of recordings onto another medium according to a
                    given criterion.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>The copy:</strong>
                    Copying a file amounts to duplicating its contents on a
                    medium. This treatment may be justified by different reason:
                    <br />
                    <span>
                      -Change the organization of the file to adapt it to
                      processing.
                    </span>
                    <br />
                    <span>-Allow faster access time.</span>

                    <span>
                      -Guarantee greater reliability to avoid loss of
                      information.

                    <br />

                After creating the file, several operations can be performed on
                its records, namely:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Creation: </strong>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Deletion: </strong>
                    which amounts to erasing one or more records. If all records
                    are deleted, we obtain an empty file.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Modification: </strong>
                    consists of changing the values of one or more fields.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Consultation: </strong>

                RAM: RAM has a limited capacity, usually measured in GB. The
                average RAM capacity in personal computers generally ranges from
                4 GB to 32 GB or more, depending on the needs and type of
                computer. RAM is much faster than secondary memory. It is
                designed for quick access to data currently in use.

                - RAM: RAM is volatile memory, which means that the data it
                contains is temporary and are erased when the computer is turned
                off or restarted. She serves primarily to store data in use by
                the processor and programs running.
                <br />
                - Secondary memory: Secondary memory is non-volatile, which
                means that the data stored there remain intact even when the
                computer is turned off. This is the place where are stored
                long-term data, such as files and programs.

                Secondary memory has a much larger capacity than RAM, ranging
                from 128 GB to several TB for common hard drives. It is used to
                store large amounts of data permanently.

                - RAM: RAM offers very fast access to data, measured in
                nanoseconds (ns), which allows the processor almost
                instantaneous access to data. -Secondary memory: Secondary
                memory is slower than RAM in terms of data access, with access
                times measured in milliseconds (ms) for hard drives. Data stored
                in secondary memory needs some time to be transferred to RAM
                before being accessible to the processor.

                - RAM: RAM is more expensive per unit of storage than secondary
                memory. The cost of RAM varies depending on capacity, speed, and
                type of RAM (DDR3, DDR4, DDR5, etc.). - Secondary memory:
                Secondary memory is generally cheaper in terms of cost per GB
                than RAM, making it a more economical way to store large amounts
                of data permanently.

                Magnetic media (Fig. 1) consist of a thin layer of magnetizable
                material, usually iron oxide, deposited on a flexible (tape) or
                rigid (disk) support. The magnetic layer is composed of magnetic
                microcells (small magnets) that can be magnetized by an electric
                current. Reading and writing operations are performed using a
                head consisting of the air gap of a magnet with an electrical
                coil wound around it. The read/write head magnetizes the surface
                of the medium in one direction or the other. The direction of

                Recording (writing) information onto the magnetic medium
                involves passing an electric current through the coil that
                constitutes the head. The passage of current through the coil
                generates a localized magnetic field, and the area (the cell) of
                the magnetic surface in front of the air gap becomes magnetized.
                This magnetization orients the particles (microcells) of the
                material. The orientation of the particles depends on the
                direction of the electric current. This is how writing is
                performed, with the orientation of the particles defining the

                To read the stored information, a read head is used to detect
                the magnetic changes on the medium. When this head passes over
                the magnetized areas (cells), an electric current is induced in
                the coil. The direction of the induced electric current depends
                on the type of magnetization. Thus, based on the direction of
                the electric current, it is possible to determine the value of
                the information that has just been read (0 or 1).

                Sequential access mode is the most common for magnetic tapes.
                Data is stored linearly on the tape, and to access a specific
                piece of data, you need to traverse the magnetic tape from the
                beginning (or from a specific point) sequentially until reaching
                the desired block. This means that data access occurs in the
                order in which it was recorded. Sequential access is generally
                slower because it requires traversing the entire magnetic tape
                or a long distance to access a specific piece of data. The
                search speed depends on the speed of the tape scrolling,
                recording density, and the total length of the tape.

                To store information on the disk, an adequate organization is
                necessary to facilitate writing and reading operations. This
                organization is referred to in computing terms as formatting.
                The formatting operation involves organizing the disk into
                tracks and sectors. Each side of a disk platter is divided into
                tracks, which are concentric circles numbered starting from 0
                from the outside. Depending on the model, the number of tracks
                per side varies from 10 to over 1,000. There is an inter-track
                space between each track where no information is recorded. Each
                track is further divided into equal-sized parts called sectors
                (ranging from 4 to 32 sectors per track), with the sector being
                the smallest unit of reading/writing on the disk. The size of a
                sector typically ranges from 32 to 4,096 bytes, with a common
                value being 512 bytes. Sectors are also separated by
                inter-sector spaces. Thus, the smallest physically accessible
                unit on the disk is the sector. To optimize reading and writing
                operations, sectors are grouped into blocks. A block consists of
                several sectors and represents the smallest unit of exchange
                between the disk and the central memory.

          "Chapter 3 addresses index structures, which are essential for accelerating the search for records in a database. It begins by defining general concepts, including the search key, which is used to retrieve specific records. The index is presented as a data structure in main memory (MM) or secondary memory (SM), offering single-key and multi-key access methods. In the context of single-key access, various types of indexes are explored, such as MM indexes, SM indexes, and multi-level indexes. The use of MM indexes for searching, inserting, and deleting records is detailed. Additionally, the process of creating, saving, and loading indexes is discussed. The chapter also covers aspects of multi-key access, where multiple attributes are used for searches. It presents techniques such as independent indexes, inverted indexes, and bitmap indexes to efficiently handle these queries. The use of MM indexes in the form of binary search trees and the exploration of large indexes are also addressed. Finally, the chapter explores the steps of a multi-key query, including the use of secondary and primary indexes to filter and retrieve relevant records. It also discusses the procedures for inserting and deleting records, emphasizing the updating of associated indexes. In summary, this chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of index structures and their effective use in database management.",

                  Sequential file structures can become inefficient when the
                  data file grows in size. Operations such as searching and
                  inserting become less efficient. Indexing methods aim to
                  enhance performance by managing an auxiliary structure (index
                  table) that accelerates the <strong>search</strong> for

                  An index is a data structure used to speed up the retrieval of
                  records in memory or on disk. It helps find specific data
                  quickly within a file or database. By organizing key-value
                  pairs or pointers, indexes make it easier to access the
                  information you need, improving the efficiency of data
                  searches.
                  <br />
                  Often, an index is an ordered table in main memory,

                <p>
                  An index is termed 'dense' if it includes all values of the
                  key attribute from the data file. In such cases, maintaining
                  the file's order based on this attribute is unnecessary.

                  <strong>2.3 Non-Dense Index (Clustered Index):</strong>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Conversely, an index is labeled 'non-dense' if it doesn't
                  encompass all values of the key attribute from the data file.
                  For instance, only one value per block or group of blocks may
                  be retained in the index. Consequently, the file must be
                  organized based on the indexed attribute. One advantage of a
                  non-dense index is its reduced size compared to a dense index
                  for the same data file.
                  <br></br>
                  <strong>→Example On dense and Non-dense index :</strong>
                  <br></br>
                  Consider a File storing information about students, where each
                  student has a unique student ID.
                </p>
                <TableSFSD />
                <p>
                  If we create an index table on the student ID column, it would
                  be considered dense because the file is Ordered on Id.
                  <br></br>
                  In this example, a dense index on the student ID does not
                  conatain all the students Id,(for example it could contain the
                  last/first student ID of each Block)
                  <br></br>
                  But if we create an index table on the department ID column,
                  it would be considered non-dense, the file is not Ordered on
                  department Id
                  <br></br>
                  In this example, a non-dense index on the department ID
                  conatains all the Departements Id

                A matrix is a mathematical structure consisting of numbers
                organized in rows and columns. Formally, a matrix is a
                rectangular grid of numerical elements. The elements of a matrix
                can be real numbers, complex numbers, or even algebraic
                expressions. A matrix is usually defined by its dimensions,
                i.e., the number of rows and the number of columns. For example,
                a matrix with m rows and n columns is called a matrix of size
                m×n.

                Calculating the determinant of a matrix by expanding along a row
                or column is a method that can be applied to matrices of any
                size. Here's a step-by-step explanation for this method
                <br />
                1- Write the matrix.
                <br />
                2- Choose a row or a column: For simplicity, let's choose the
                first row (you can choose any row or column).
                <br />
                3- Expand along the chosen row: The determinant of matrix A can
                be calculated by taking the sum of the products of the elements
                of the row and their corresponding cofactors.The cofactor Cij​

                <br />
                1- Write the matrix.
                <br />
                2- Copy the first two columns to the right of the matrix.
                <br />
                3- Calculate the products of the downward diagonals (from top
                left to bottom right) and sum them.
                <br />
                <strong>aei+bfg+cdh</strong>

                - bfg: product of the elements of the second downward diagonal.
                <br />
                - cdh: product of the elements of the third downward diagonal.
                <br />
                4- Calculate the products of the upward diagonals (from bottom
                left to top right) and sum them:
                <br />
                <stong>ceg+bdi+afh</stong>
                <br />
                - ceg: product of the elements of the main upward diagonal.
                <br />
                - bdi: product of the elements of the second upward diagonal.
                <br />
                - afh: product of the elements of the third upward diagonal.
                <br />
                5- Subtract the sum of the upward diagonal products from the sum
                of the downward diagonal products:
                <br />
                Determinant=(aei+bfg+cdh)−(ceg+bdi+afh)

                In summary, the determinant of matrix A is given by the formula:

                A matrix is a mathematical structure consisting of numbers
                organized in rows and columns. Formally, a matrix is a
                rectangular grid of numerical elements. The elements of a matrix
                can be real numbers, complex numbers, or even algebraic
                expressions. A matrix is usually defined by its dimensions,
                i.e., the number of rows and the number of columns. For example,
                a matrix with m rows and n columns is called a matrix of size
                m×n.

                Calculating the determinant of a matrix by expanding along a row
                or column is a method that can be applied to matrices of any
                size. Here's a step-by-step explanation for this method
                <br />
                1- Write the matrix.
                <br />
                2- Choose a row or a column: For simplicity, let's choose the
                first row (you can choose any row or column).
                <br />
                3- Expand along the chosen row: The determinant of matrix A can
                be calculated by taking the sum of the products of the elements
                of the row and their corresponding cofactors.The cofactor Cij​

                <br />
                4- Calculate the products of the upward diagonals (from bottom

                - bdi: product of the elements of the second upward diagonal.
                <br />
                - afh: product of the elements of the third upward diagonal.
                <br />
                5- Subtract the sum of the upward diagonal products from the sum
                of the downward diagonal products:

                The matrix representation of a linear transformation is a matrix
                form that describes how this application acts on the vectors of
                a vector space. This matrix representation facilitates the
                analysis and manipulation of linear transformations using
                algebraic tools and matrix operations.

                A matrix is a mathematical structure consisting of numbers
                organized in rows and columns. Formally, a matrix is a
                rectangular grid of numerical elements. The elements of a matrix
                can be real numbers, complex numbers, or even algebraic
                expressions. A matrix is usually defined by its dimensions,
                i.e., the number of rows and the number of columns. For example,
                a matrix with m rows and n columns is called a matrix of size
                m×n.
