# Zidni eLearning Platform

Welcome to Zidni, an eLearning platform tailored for computer science students. Zidni provides a comprehensive and interactive learning experience, helping you master computer science concepts through engaging content and practical assessments, this project was developed as part of our coursework at the Université des Sciences et de la Technologie Houari Boumediene (USTHB).

## What We Offer

### Interactive Lessons with Visualizations

Our courses are designed to bring complex computer science concepts to life. Through interactive visualizations, we make learning more engaging and effective, helping you grasp difficult topics with ease.

### Quizzes for Assessment

To reinforce your learning, we have implemented quizzes that test your understanding of the material. These quizzes provide immediate feedback, allowing you to track your progress and identify areas for improvement.

## Who We Are

We are a dedicated team of 2nd-year computer science engineering students from Université of Houari Boumediene. Our goal is to enhance the learning experience for fellow students by leveraging our expertise and creativity.

## Features in Development

### Progress Tracking

We are actively working on a progress tracking feature that will allow you to monitor your learning journey and measure your improvement over time.
